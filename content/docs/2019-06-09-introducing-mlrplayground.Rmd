First of all, you may ask yourself how is this name 'mlrPlayground' even justified?
What a mad man puts two such opposite meanings in a single word and expects people to take him serious? I assume you all know 'mlr' -- it's about productivity, simplicity and especially getting your work done as easily and quickly as possible without any annoyances.
Quite the opposite from a place, where you can play with your best friends, make new friends, live out your fantasies and just have a great time the whole day until your parents pick you up.
Well, for most of the readers here this may not be the case anymore -- we know, we are still young in our heart, but let's be honest ... But for sure, we all have those memories and definitely have certain associations by the word 'Playground'.
So what is it then with this thing called 'mlrPlayground'?
The idea behind this project was to offer a platform, where a user can try out all different kinds of learners provided in the mlr package ... [WIP]
